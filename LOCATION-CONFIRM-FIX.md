# Location Confirm Endpoint Fix

## Issue
- Frontend getting 404 error when trying to confirm location selection
- `/api/location/confirm` endpoint not found

## Root Cause
- The `/confirm` endpoint was added to LocationController but service wasn't restarted
- Location service needs restart to pick up new endpoint

## Fix Applied
1. **Added `/confirm` endpoint** to LocationController.java
2. **Fixed HTML entity encoding** in console logs (useWebSocket.js)

## Files Modified
- `backend/location-service/src/main/java/com/peraxis/location/controller/LocationController.java`
- `frontend/customer-app/src/hooks/useWebSocket.js`

## How to Apply Fix
1. Run `fix-location-confirm.bat` to restart location service
2. Wait 30 seconds for service to fully start
3. Test location confirmation in frontend

## Expected Results
- ✅ Location confirmation works without 404 errors
- ✅ Clean console logs without HTML entities
- ✅ Map location selection and confirmation functional

## Endpoint Details
```java
@PostMapping("/confirm")
public ResponseEntity<?> confirmLocation(@RequestBody LocationRequest request) {
    // Caches confirmed location and returns success response
}
```

The endpoint accepts:
```json
{
  "latitude": 14.7356599,
  "longitude": 78.582353,
  "address": "Full address string"
}
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Location confirmed successfully",
  "data": { ... }
}
```
